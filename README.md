# Bloggly
_A Profile to fulfil all your blogging needs._

Bloggly was made for one of Drupal's GCI 2018 tasks - _Build a Drupal Distribution for blogging._

### How I knew I could make this?
For making Bloggly, I referred the [Drupal Documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/distributions) which provided all the required step-by-step information I needed.
